\# Sentiment Analysis on Restaurant Reviews



\## Problem Statement

Businesses receive thousands of customer reviews.

Manual sentiment analysis is not scalable.

This project predicts whether a review is Positive or Negative.



\## Dataset

• Restaurant customer reviews

• Cleaned and manually labeled

• Balanced positive and negative samples



\## Models Implemented

1\. TF-IDF + Logistic Regression

2\. Word2Vec + Logistic Regression

3\. Pretrained Transformer (DistilBERT)



\## Evaluation

• Accuracy

• Confusion Matrix

• Cross Validation

• Testing on confusing / mixed reviews



\## Key Insights

• TF-IDF performed best on this dataset

• Word2Vec underperformed due to limited data

• DistilBERT handled context better but is resource intensive



\## Tools Used

Python, pandas, scikit-learn, gensim, transformers
